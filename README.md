### A Proof of Concept Django Site for tracking COVID-19.

This repo currently encompasses the functionality aspect of the site.

The design of the site can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/pcjz6xb3Rz6SEE8yCGqp6s/EDD-Project?node-id=22%3A14).

In the future, this will go in one of two directions:

2. `django-rest` + `react` / `vue`
1. add `material.io` / `bootstrap4`
